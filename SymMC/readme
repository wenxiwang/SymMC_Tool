This is the basic version of SymMC for counting both the desired counts (i.e., count under NSB and count under FSB)
To build SymMC, please go to SymMC directory and run ./build.sh
To run SymMC for all the subjects, please go to the root directory (where this readme is), and run ./runAll.sh
To add subjects, please add the cnf file and the symmetry info to the "InputFiles/cnfs" and "InputFiles/SymInfo" folder, respectively; we give an example in the corresponding folder;
